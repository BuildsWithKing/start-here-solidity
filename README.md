# 🪄 New to Solidity? Learn with Michealking.

Welcome, builder 👋

This repository is part of my **30 Day Solidity Challenge** — a daily builder journey where I created and shipped one smart contract project almost every day. It starts from beginner basics like userStorage and gradually progresses to advanced topics with modifiers, mappings, structs, ETH transfers, and more.

But I didn’t start with all this knowledge.

If you're new to Solidity, this page will help you get started step-by-step and follow along with my journey, even if you’re a beginner.

## ⏾ How to Use This Repo

Start from Day 1: [UserStorage.sol](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/30-days-solidity-challenge/tree/main/Day001-UserStorage)

Each project is inside its own folder (or contract file)

Read the code + comments

Try building it yourself in Remix

Feel free to fork, clone, and experiment.

## 💡 What I Recommend for Beginners

1. Go slow — focus on understanding contract, function, mapping, etc.


2. Build with your hands — type out code yourself


3. Don’t just copy — customize each contract


4. Read code explanations in the comments


5. Keep going — it gets easier the more you build
